## Overview
This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors based on features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. The model helps in early detection, which can be crucial for treatment and survival rates.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset** available from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset).  
It contains 569 samples of tumors with 30 features and a target variable (`malignant` or `benign`).

## Features
Some important features used in this dataset include:  
- Radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)  
- Texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)  
- Perimeter  
- Area  
- Smoothness  
- Compactness  
- Concavity  
- Symmetry

## Technologies
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
